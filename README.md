## Introduction

The CSES Problem Set is a popular collection of competitive programming problems designed to help programmers enhance their problem-solving skills. This repository is my personal collection of solutions to these problems, written in C++.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the categories of problems. Each directory contains solutions to the problems in that category. The structure is as follows:

    File Naming : Each file is named according to the problem title.
    File Format : Solutions are written in C++.

## How to Use

Each solution is contained in its own file. The file is named according to the problem it solves. For example, `apartments.cpp` might correspond to the first problem in the "Sorting and Searching" category.

To use a solution, simply navigate to the appropriate directory and run the solution file with the appropriate command for the programming language. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a better solution or an optimization, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Please make sure to follow the existing coding style and include comments where necessary.

## Contact

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me at [your email address] or open an issue in this repository.

Happy coding!
